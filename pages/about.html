					<p> The Nostromo was constructed in 2101 as an interstellar
						cruiser, but was refitted in 2116 as a commercial towing vehicle.
						The ship was subsequently operated as a commercial hauler, transporting automated ore and oil
						refineries between outer colonies and Earth.
						As part of this retrofit, the ship's original Saturn J-3000 engines were removed and replaced with
						the two immensely powerful Rolls-Royce N66
						Cyclone thrust engines, with bipolar vectoring for midline lift function. Each of these N66 cyclone
						powerplants developed 65,830 metric tons of
						thrust, using water for reaction mass. When running at full power, the engines produced a high
						impulse thrust total of 131,660 kN. The seven
						hypersleep chambers that would accommodate the crew during long-durationb flight were also installed
						at this time. Many of the ships background
						systems, including it's auto-pilot feature, were controlled by MU/TH/UR 6000 ("Mother"), the ship's
						artificial intelligence computer mainframe.</p>

				<p class="text-center aboutbody" data-aos="fade-up"> The interior of the Nostromo was designed by conceptual artist Ron
					Cobb. The look of the Nostromo's corridors was designed to evoke the feeling of a World War II
					submarine. Much of the interior was dressed with various aircraft parts, acquired by the production team
					from RAF stock that was being decommissioned nearby at the
					time; for example, the crew chairs on the bridge were taken from fighter aircraft, with at least some of
					them being ejector seats. Much of the set dressing in the
					medbay was genuine medical equipment.
					The Mother interface room was designed to mimic a niche in a cathedral, with the myriad of blinking
					lights representing candles. Much of the ship's interior was
					fully functional, in that many of the various buttons actually performed some function when activated.
					The ship's bridge was originally designed as a large,
					open space with several "floating" consoles and crew seats that projected into a vast glass window at
					its front. However, cost concerns meant this ambitious
					set was scrapped in favor of a cheaper design. The Nostromo bridge set contains some 40 video monitors,
					all of which are fully functional.</p>
