					<p class="storybody">A special department that dealt with the research and development of biological and
						viral weapons. One of their primary goals was to obtain a viable
						specimen of the species they designate <i>Xenomorph XX121</i>, whether it be in the form of a <i>Facehugger</i>, a
						<i>Chestburster</i> or a <i>Drone</i>>; in some cases an immature <i>Chestburster</i>
						sample was considered preferable due to the ease with which one could be passed through quarantine
						undetected within their hosts. <span style="color: rgba(255, 180, 68, 0.897)">Weyland-Yutani</span> believed that biological
						self-replicating weapons such as the <i>Xenomorph</i> could form a ubiquitous component of distant force
						projection operations, which were otherwise vulnerable to unforeseen
						threats capable of exhausting traditional security personnel and ammunition stores that may not be
						easily replenished across the vast distances of space.</p>

					<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Reverse-Engineering Division</h1>
					<br />
					<p>The Reverse-Engineering Division was mainly focused on the study and implementation of recovered
						<i>Yautja</i> (Predator) technology. The department was largely built upon the work carried
						out by <span style="color: cyan">Borgia Industries</span> and the <span style="color: cyan">Yutani Corporation</span>,
						both of which were incorporated into <span style="color: rgba(255, 180, 68, 0.897)">Weyland-Yutani</span> through business
						mergers (with the Yutani Corporation being a major partner and partial originator of the company's name).
						As with the company's Bio-Weapons Division, Weyland-Yutani's reverse-engineering projects were
						generally run with little regard for morals, although owing to the research
						being based primarily on the study of appropriated technology, the scope for appalling breaches of
						human rights was less open. Even so, the division ruthlessly captured and
						exploited alien tech, stealing <i>Predator</i> and <i>Engineer</i> (rumoured ancestors of the <i>Xenomorphs</i>) technology with little thought as to how the
						species that created it may react. As a result, the company often ran afoul
						of the <i>Yautja</i>, who were fiercely protective of their advanced technology and considered the
						slaughter of any who would attempt to steal it a cultural necessity.</p>
