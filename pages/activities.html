				<p>Some time prior to 2122, <span style="color: rgba(255, 180, 68, 0.897)">Weyland-Yutani</span> 
					detected the signal being broadcast from the derelict on
					<span style="color:yellow">Acheron (LV-426)</span>, the middle moon of three orbiting the ringed planet
					<span style="color:yellow">Calpamos</span>. While the language was unknown, the company succeeded in deciphering enough of the
					message
					to learn it was a warning regarding the deadly species <i>Xenomorph</i>.
					They subsequently dispatched the <span style="color:cyan">USCSS Nostromo</span> to investigate,
					leading to initial human contact with the <i>Xenomorph</i>. The incident and the existence of the
					<i>Xenomorph</i> was initially kept from the media, while the beacon was
					later deactivated by the crew of the <span style="color:cyan">USCSS Anesidora</span>.</p>

				<h1 style="font-size: 54px">Colonization</h1>
				<br />
				<p>By 2137, <span style="color: rgba(255, 180, 68, 0.897)">Weyland-Yutani</span> was heavily involved in the colonization of extrasolar planets, including
					the	terraforming of suitable bodies with inhospitable atmospheres through the construction of <span style="color: greenyellow">Atmosphere Processing Plants</span>.
					Over its history, the company constructed and administrated numerous colonies across the galaxy, including <span style="color:cyan">Hadley's Hope</span> —
					ironically established on <span style="color:yellow">LV-426</span>, the very moon where the <span style="color:cyan">USCSS Nostromo</span> had encountered
					the deadly <i>Xenomorph</i> — and <span style="color: cyan">Freya's Prospect</span> on <span style="color:yellow">BG-386</span>.	
					Weyland-Yutani was also involved in non-civilian colonies, notably overseeing the
					<span style="color:greenyellow">Class C Work Correctional Unit</span> and the associated industrial penal lead foundry on <span style="color:yellow">Fiorina "Fury" 161</span>. In November of 2137, the company
					learned of a new <i>Xenomorph</i> incident on <span style="color:cyan">Sevastopol Station</span>, and promptly purchased the failing facility from its competitor Seegson in the hopes of again securing
					samples of the creature. However, the station and all the creatures aboard were destroyed before the company could complete their goals.</p>

				<p>As well as its colonization efforts, <span style="color: rgba(255, 180, 68, 0.897)">Weyland-Yutani</span> also operated numerous research and
					development	facilities throughout the galaxy, often pursuing top-secret research into illegal or dangerous fields, focusing in particular on the study of
					the <i>Xenomorph</i> species. Major Weyland-Yutani laboratories included installations on
					<span style="color:yellow">LV-1201</span> and <span style="color:yellow">BG-386</span>, and the <span style="color:cyan">Origin Facility</span> on <span style="color:yellow">LV-426</span>.
					These labs often operated under particularly amoral	conditions, especially where <i>Xenomorph</i> research was concerned; humans were frequently used as unwilling hosts
					for the creatures, while some teams were even known	to deliberately sacrifice low-level Weyland-Yutani employees as live prey in <i>Xenomorph</i> tests.
					On <span style="color:yellow">BG-386</span>, inhabitants from the planet's civilian colony were apparently abducted for use in research, often under the pretence of being
					"promoted" to a new position elsewhere on the planet.</p>
